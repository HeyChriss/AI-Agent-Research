1. ### Introduction

The advent of deep learning has revolutionized the field of image classification, with Residual Networks (ResNet) emerging as a pivotal architecture that addresses the challenges of training very deep networks. ResNet introduces shortcut connections that bypass one or more layers, effectively mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and enabling the training of networks with significantly increased depth. This innovation has led to substantial improvements in classification accuracy across various datasets and applications.

### Hypothesis

The implementation of Residual Networks (ResNet) significantly improves the accuracy of image classification tasks compared to traditional deep learning architectures. This hypothesis is grounded in the architectural advantages of ResNet, particularly its ability to maintain gradient flow through deep networks, thereby enhancing learning efficiency and accuracy.

   - **Authors**: Mohammad Sadegh Ebrahimi, Hossein Karkeh Abadi
   - **Published**: April 21, 2018
   - **Summary**: This paper discusses the advantages of ResNets in training deep neural networks, particularly addressing the vanishing gradient problem. The authors designed a ResNet model for the Tiny ImageNet dataset and compared its performance with a traditional Convolutional Network (ConvNet). The findings indicate that while ResNets achieve higher accuracy, they are more prone to overfitting, necessitating techniques like dropout and data augmentation.

   - **Published**: August 31, 2024
   - **Summary**: This research introduces dilated ResNet models for classifying retinal fundus images. By replacing normal convolution filters with dilated filters, the study aims to enhance classification accuracy while reducing computation time. The evaluation metrics included precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score, demonstrating the effectiveness of dilated ResNets in medical diagnostics.

### Conclusion

The literature indicates that Residual Networks (ResNet) provide significant advantages in image classification tasks, particularly in terms of accuracy and training efficiency. However, challenges such as overfitting remain, necessitating further research into regularization techniques and model optimization.
